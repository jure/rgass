A JS implementation of RGASS, a CRDT synchronization algorithm presented in research paper by Xiao Lv et al: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2016.10.005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2016.10.005).

# Getting started

This module is still experimental, but it's easy to play with it already:
1. Clone this repository and
2. `npm install`, then 
3. `npm start` 
4. and open at least two browser windows pointing to `localhost:3000`.

Now you can test its collaborative text editing functionality. There is also a battletest (see below) that will automatically add and delete strings in two text areas concurrently and raise an error if there is a mismatch, as a way to fuzz test the algorithm.

# To run tests

```
npm test
```

# To run battletest

```
npm run battletest
```

# TODO

- [ ] Resolve issue with overlapping concurrent insertions and deletions, that the algorihtm described in the paper doesn't address (there is a currently failing test describing the above scenario).
- [ ] Serialization of Model
- [ ] Snapshotting (related to above)
- [ ] More bulletproofing
